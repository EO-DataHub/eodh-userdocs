# Applications

!!! note 
    Commercial datasets available on the Hub enhance the potential to combine high-resolution and high-revisit imagery, for advanced spatial analysis that can build a more holistic analysis and inform decision-making.

The user case studies presented in this section showcase how others have leveraged the power of satellite data acquisitions provided by Airbus and Planet to create novel insights and carry out reliable asset monitoring. The commercial datasets available are suitable for the purposes of both general users and EO specialists, where basic users can utilise imagery for mapping and GIS analysis, image classification, change detection and AI computer vision applications, while advanced users can carry out empirical and physical modelling, data calibration, atmospheric correction and 3D modelling or photogrammetry applications.

### Pléiades

Pléiades can support many application areas including:

* Defence. Available satellite resource with a true daily revisit capability, enabling routine or intensive monitoring of regional conflicts, border areas, and early detection and prevention of armed conflicts and humanitarian crises. The satellite’s advanced agility is particularly well-suited for updating military maps in strategic areas.
* Land administration. Particularly adapted to urban planning, housing and transportation management, land use mapping (at scales of up to 1:10,000 and 1:5,000), assessing urban sprawl, and monitoring new infrastructure.
* Agriculture. Especially well-suited for monitoring fragmented landscapes, small parcels, experimental micro-plots, and groves/permanent crops, but also for crop yields estimation, irrigation recommendations, agricultural inputs optimization.
* Forest and environment. Valuable tool for running forest inventories and monitoring changes, forest operations (Wood planting, harvesting…).
