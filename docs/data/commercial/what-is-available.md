## Airbus

### Supported Collections

Airbus operates the most comprehensive constellation of optical and radar commercial Earth observation satellites available on the market today. The EODH provides global access to archive data of Airbus optical imagery with 30cm to 1.5m spatial resolution, and radar imagery from 25cm to 40m.

=== "Pléiades Neo"

    Airbus' most advanced optical satellites with the highest spatial resolution and capacity. Two identical satellites launched in 2021 with seven spectral bands, 30cm native resolution and daily revisit.

=== "Pléiades" 
    Very high-resolution optical satellites with a global archive back to 2012. Two identical satellites with five spectral bands, daily revisit delivering 50cm image products.

=== "SPOT"
    Efficiently image large areas at 1.5m resolution. Revisit every other day and a global archive back to 2012.

=== "Radar Constellation"
    Reliably acquires the widest range of radar satellite images, from the highest resolution to wide area coverage - regardless of weather and daylight conditions. Imagery in 6 different imaging modes with a flexible spatial resolution (from 25cm to 40m) and area coverage (footprint). Global mean revisit time < 24 hours, and an archive back to 2007.


### Pléiades Neo
Experience the forefront of Earth observation innovation with Pléiades Neo Airbus's leading optical constellation featuring two identical 30cm resolution satellites renowned for their ultimate reactivity. Since its launch in 2021, this innovative constellation has revolutionised the landscape of Earth observation-based services, setting new standards of precision and reliability.

* Two identical satellites with 30cm native resolution imagery
* Location accuracy: 3.5m CE90
* Reactive tasking, rapid delivery
* Acquisition capacity of 1 million km² per day and daily revisit, anywhere
* Multispectral imagery (including Deep Blue / Red Edge)
* Mono, stereo & tri-stereo acquisition capability

### Pléiades

The identical Pléiades 1A and Pléiades 1B satellites deliver 50cm imagery products with a 20km swath. Their location accuracy and image quality are excellent, making them an ideal source of data for both civil or military projects. The space and ground segment have been designed to provide data in record time, ensuring daily revisit capacity anywhere on the globe and unrivalled reliability when it comes to collecting new images.

* Very high-resolution multispectral twin satellites (50cm products)
* Daily revisit capacity and highly reactive tasking
* Advanced agility including 5 collection scenarios: target, strip mapping, tri-stereo, corridor and persistent monitoring
* Stereo / tristereo capacity and fresh archive

### SPOT

The ideal solution for country-wide, demanding applications. Designed to efficiently cover huge areas in record time, making it a perfect choice for cartography and monitoring applications.

* 1.5m resolution products, ideal for topographic mapping: from 1:30,000 to 1:7,500 scale maps
* Twin satellites with revisit every other day (SPOT 6 and 71), and a global archive back to 2012.
* Stereo and tri-stereo capacity
* 2D and 3D stereo plotting, geometric accuracy down to 6 to 10m CE90, elevation and contour lines
* 3 Million km² per day, per satellite

### Radar Constellation
Radar image acquisition in a unique constellation. The German TerraSAR-X / TanDEM-X satellites are being operated in the same orbit tube and feature identical ground swaths and imaging modes. The satellites carry a high frequency X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensor to acquire datasets ranging from very high-resolution imagery to wide area coverage.

* Radar Constellation 'toolbox': Imagery in 6 different imaging modes with a flexible spatial resolution (from 25cm to 40m) and area coverage (footprint)
* Weather and daylight independent site access to any point on Earth
* High agility (rapid switches between different imaging modes and polarisations)
* TerraSAR-X, and TanDEM-X have an orbit repeat of 11 days for InSAR applications, and a global mean revist time < 24 hrs
* Unrivalled geometric accuracy and excellent radiometric accuracy



## Planet

### Supported Collections

Planet operates the PlanetScope (PS) and SkySat (SS) Earth-imaging constellations. Imagery is collected and processed in a variety of formats to serve different use cases, be it mapping, deep learning, disaster response, precision agriculture, or simple temporal image analytics to create rich information products.


=== "PlanetScope (Download and Tile View)"

    * PlanetScope Visual
    * PlanetScope: analytic_sr_udm2, analytic_8b_sr_udm2 (Surface Reflectance images)
    * PlanetScope: basic_analytic_udm2, basic_analytic_8b_udm2 (TOAR images)
    * Skysat Archive Download and Tile View

=== "SkySat (Visual)"

    * SkySat: pansharpened_udm2
    * SkySat: analytic_sr_udm2 (Surface Reflectance images)
    * SkySat: basic_analytic_udm2 (TOAR images)

### PlanetScope

PlanetScope satellite imagery is captured as a continuous strip of single frame images known as “scenes.” Scenes are derived from multiple generations of PlanetScope satellites capturing images with a single RGB (red, green, blue) frame or a split-frame with a RGB half and a NIR (near-infrared) half, with a multistripe frame with bands divided between RGBNIR or RGBNIR, red edge, green I, yellow and coastal blue. Planet offers two product lines for PlanetScope imagery: a Basic Scene product and Ortho Scene product. The Basic Scene product is a scaled Top of Atmosphere Radiance (at sensor) and sensor-corrected product. The Basic Scene product is designed for users with advanced image processing and geometric correction capabilities. The product is not orthorectified or corrected for terrain distortions. Ortho Scenes represent the single-frame image captures as acquired by a PlanetScope satellite with additional post processing applied.

### SkySat

SkySat imagery is captured similarly to PlanetScope in a continuous strip of single frame images known as “scenes,” which are all acquired in the blue, green, red, nir-infrared, and panchromatic bands. SkySat data is available on the Hub as the SkySat Collect product.
