# Linking Planet and Airbus accounts to the EODH

!!! info
    Users are able to associate their commercial data account tokens with their EODH account in the [workspaces]() page as long as those providers are supported by the Hub. Airbus and Planet are currently supported. The process for each supported data provider, respectively, is outlined below.

## Airbus

To access Airbus content on the EODH, your OneAtlas account must be configured with a contract that will send ordered data to the EODH.

* Request a OneAtlas account via the website if you are not already a customer. New customers are first onboarded by the Airbus customer service team.
* Contact the Airbus customer service team at ukintelligence-imagerysupport@airbus.com stating that you would like access to Airbus Optical, and/or Radar data via the EODH.
* The Airbus team will create new contracts to operate on the EODH.
* Once this is complete, please self-serve an Airbus API Key via the OneAtlas Developer Portal ‘Get your API Key’.

The Airbus API key then be registered to a workspace in the EODH platform under 'Linked accounts' for a selected workspace on the workspaces page. If you have multiple contracts associated with the key then you must choose which ones to assign to the workspace. By default these will be auto assigned based on the input API key. The linked API key and contracts will then be used for orders placed by members of the workspace, and data will be delivered directly to the workspace. See here for more details.

## Planet

Existing Planet accounts can be accessed via the EODH by using their API key. Please use these instructions if you need help locating your API key. To create a Planet account, please email the Planet team. Contact eodatahub@planet.com for dedicated support with Planet access.

The Planet API key can then be registered to a workspace in the EODH platform under ’Linked accounts’ for a selected workspace on the ’Workspaces’ page. The linked API key will then be used for orders placed by members of the workspace, and data will be delivered directly to the workspace. See here for more details.
