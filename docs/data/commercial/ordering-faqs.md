Commercial data ordering FAQs

What is the minimum area AOI for data orders?
Airbus
For Airbus, Optical PPO contracts have a minimum archive order size of 25km2. Radar PPO contracts have a minimum order size of one full scene, meaning Radar imagery orders cannot be clipped to an AOI. There are options available for very granual data access - please contact andrew.tewkesbury@airbus.com to discuss.

Planet
For Planet, we would recommend people with specific needs contact Planet directly. Planet do have a minimum order size, but that could for example refer to a data distributed over a long period. And for that case only SkySat would work.



Can I accidentally purchase an image?
Before a transaction can carried out to purchase a commercial image, the user is first met with the following checkboxes (see pictured). These are in place to ensure the user understands the licensing agreement they are accepting by making the purchase. The user must agree that they have:



Read and accepted the product license
Read and accepted the vendor terms and conditions
Give their consent to the EODH to place the order on behalf of the user

Please ensure you have read and consented to all the agreements before placing the purchase, the relevant documents for which are linked under Read more. If you require more information regarding the license agreements, these are published by the data providers, Planet and Airbus, respectively. Alternatively, check back to our documentation section on licensing restrictions.


Cost of the imagery selection is clearly displayed at the bottom right of the checkout page in green. It is important to also ensure you are happy with the total cost before proceeding with the purchase.

In the case where a user makes an accidental order by proceeding through the checkout screen to point of purchase, please note that the order cannot be changed after delivery. As such, the user should ensure thorough checks are carried out before purchasing to ensure the correct product, resolution, date, and image provider have been selected as intended.



Where can I find my imagery once purchased?
Navigate to your personal workspace catalogue, found in the Catalogue tab of the EODH website, where any purchased imagery will appear. This can be associated with your individual or organisational workspace account. Purchased imagery specifically will be found within the commercial-data catalogue, within the workspace catalogue. Note that item assets may take a while to appear after purchasing. Check the item in your workspace for the status of the order.



Do the commercial datasets have global coverage, or UK only?
The commercial data spatial coverage is not limited in availability to the UK only. There is data available for areas of interest worldwide. Open a data collection in the map search window of the Resource Catalogue to explore coverage for a specific area of interest. You can do this by drawing a polygon on the map to constrain your search, whereby the item list will only return imagery with footprints overlapping the drawn polygon. Find out more about how to search data collections for spatial coverage of a specific area of interest here.
