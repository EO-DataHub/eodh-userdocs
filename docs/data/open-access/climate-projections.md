# Climate Projections

Climate Projections include simulated data of the climate from different models with various conditions and radiative forcings. These climate model projections show how climate is likely to change in the future, based on given scenarios. Temporal extent of these collections runs into the future, starting from present day.

To construct a climate model, scientists create a three-dimensional grid covering the Earth's surface and atmosphere, and simulate interactions over time between grid cells. Simulations are run under different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) or Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), which represent varying assumptions about future emissions, land use, and policy decisions. This data is then spatially gridded as a modelled image product.
