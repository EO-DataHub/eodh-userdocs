## Multispectral
Multispectral satellite imagery refers to images captured by sensors that record data in multiple distinct spectral bands across the electromagnetic spectrum. These bands typically include visible light (red, green, blue) and extend into near-infrared (NIR) and sometimes shortwave infrared (SWIR) regions.

### Capabilities

* Multiple Bands. Usually 4–13 bands, each sensitive to a specific wavelength range.

* Beyond Human Vision. Includes wavelengths invisible to the naked eye, enabling detection of features like vegetation health or soil moisture.

* Spatial Resolution. Varies by satellite (e.g., Landsat ~30m, Sentinel-2 ~10m).
