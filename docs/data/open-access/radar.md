# Radar

Radar satellite data refers to information collected by satellites equipped with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors. Unlike optical sensors, radar systems use microwave signals to actively illuminate the Earth's surface and measure the reflected signals.

## Capabilities

This gives radar satellites unique capabilities:

* All-weather capability: Radar penetrates clouds, fog, and rain, making it useful in any weather.
* Day and night imaging: Since radar uses its own energy source, it doesn’t rely on sunlight.
* Surface penetration: Certain radar wavelengths can penetrate vegetation, snow, and even soil to some depth.
* High spatial resolution: SAR can produce detailed images of terrain and structures.
