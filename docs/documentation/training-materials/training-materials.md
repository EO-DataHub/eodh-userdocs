# Training materials

This repository aims to provide a live set of documents to demonstrate how to use the EODH and associated tools such as the pyeodh Python API client, eoap-gen workflow generator and QGIS plugin. Other training materials may be added to this repository in future.

Whether you’re a user looking to explore the project or a developer wanting to contribute, you’ll find all the information you need here.

## Example Jupyter notebooks

The following example Jupyter notebooks hosted on GitHub are a great place to get started learning the range of EO DataHub capabilities. Explore the sample code below.

* [Data search in pyeodh](https://github.com/EO-DataHub/eodh-training/blob/main/presentations/Workshop/1_202502_workshop_DataDiscovery.ipynb)
* [Order commercial data in Python](https://github.com/EO-DataHub/eodhp-guide/blob/main/examples/uc9-data-discovery-and-analysis/CommercialDataOrdering.ipynb)
* [Visualise imagery using TiTiler](https://github.com/EO-DataHub/eodhp-guide/blob/main/examples/data-visualisation/workspace-data-visualisation.ipynb)
* [Deploy and run a workflow on the Workflow Runner](https://github.com/EO-DataHub/eodh-training/blob/main/presentations/Workshop/2_202502_workshop_DataProcessing.ipynb)
* [Transfer data between workspaces in S3](https://github.com/EO-DataHub/eodhp-guide/blob/main/examples/s3-data-transfer/s3-data-transfer.ipynb)

## Example workflows

See our public GitHub repository to explore example workflows, defined as Common Workflow Language (CWL) scripts, available from the EODH. To get started, you can deploy an example workflow to your workspace via the Workflow Runner, and try out executing it on a set of defined inputs.

Some of the example workflows in the repository are developed by the project consortium partners. Other examples are taken from other public workflow examples, and shared here.
