# Applications

## Climate Asset Risk Analysis Tool (CLARAT)

The Climate Asset Risk Analysis Tool (CLARAT), an application powered by the EODH, derives hazard indicator datasets from climate projections stored on EODH. When a user requests an asset portfolio risk assessment, the EODH provides cloud computing infrastructure to run workflows that determine exposure and vulnerability. CLARAT helps assess the future exposure and vulnerability of physical assets to climate hazards, such as chronic heat, based on climate projections for various scenarios. It also incorporates historic Earth Observation data, like land surface temperature, to enhance understanding of local variations such as urban heat islands. This helps decision-makers make informed financial, economic, and policy decisions. CLARAT’s user-friendly, no-code interface is designed for entry-level to intermediate users with limited experience in Earth Observation data and workflows.

## EOPro

EOPro aims to provide a web based user-friendly platform for both new and advanced users of Earth Observation (EO) data, especially those already familiar with geospatial software. Powered by the EODH, its primary goal is to allow users to run predefined scenarios and obtain meaningful outputs without needing to understand the specifics of source data types. Predefined scenarios available at this stage are Land Cover Changes and Water Quality Analysis scenarios. EOPro also enables users to adjust inputs and learn how these changes affect results, serving as both a learning tool and a frontend for streamlined EO processing. Additionally, EOPro caters to intermediate users by offering a quick, code-free method for defining workflow inputs for specific tasks. The core feature of EOPro is the Action Creator, a powerful tool that helps users create customized workflows for processing EO data and providing clear visual and numeric results through built in visualization and analysis tools

* _Prerequisites_: No prior EO experience
