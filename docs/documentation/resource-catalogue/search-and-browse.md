# Finding data 

Once you've discovered a collection of interest, this chapter will guide you through finding specific data within that collection, including how to navigate the interface, use the map view, and manage your selected data.

## Opening a Collection
To begin working with a specific collection:

* Navigate to the collection's card on the browse page
* Click on the card
* Select "Open Collection"

## The Collection Interface

When you open a collection, you'll see:

* A map display showing data coverage areas
* A list of scenes on the left side, including:
* Scene title
* Date
* Cloud cover percentage

## Navigating the Scene List

The most recent scenes appear first. Hover over items in the list to highlight corresponding areas on the map. Use the scroll bar or pagination controls to view more scenes. As you scroll, additional data will load on the map.

## Defining Your Area of Interest

You can narrow down your search to a specific geographic area in two ways:

* Map Zoom
    * Zoom in on the map. The scene list will automatically update to show only data for the visible area.
* Drawing a Polygon
    * Click the "Draw" button (polygon tool)
    * Draw your area of interest on the map
    * The scene list will update to show only data within your defined area

## Viewing Data on the Map

To view a specific scene:

* Click the display icon next to a scene in the list
* The data will be added to the map
* A pinned item will appear in the list

You can add multiple scenes to the map, and they will be listed in the pinned items section.

## Display Styles

Different collections offer various display styles. For example, the CEDA ARD collection includes:

* Natural Color
* Color Infrared
* Short-wave Infrared
* Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)

To change the display style:

1. Select your preferred style from the visualization menu
2. Add scenes to the map using the new style
3. You can display the same scene in different styles

## Managing Pinned Items

The pinned items list shows all scenes currently displayed on the map. You can:

* Remove Items
    * Click the close (X) icon to remove a scene. The scene will disappear from both the map and the list.
* Toggle Visibility
    * Use the visibility toggle to temporarily hide/show scenes. This helps when comparing different data layers.
* Adjust Opacity
    * Use the opacity slider to make scenes more or less transparent. This is useful for viewing underlying base maps or comparing multiple layers.

## Filtering by Cloud Cover

To find scenes with specific cloud cover characteristics:

1. Click the filter icon above the scene list
2. Adjust the cloud cover percentage slider
3. Click "Apply" to update the list


This helps you find the clearest scenes for your area of interest.
