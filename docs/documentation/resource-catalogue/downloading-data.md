# Downloading data

Open datasets can be downloaded from the catalogue to be used locally or imported into third-party software. Commercial data can be downloaded, once an order has been placed, from the My Data area. More information on this can be found here. Following the steps below for commercial data collections will allow you to download a thumbnail of the image, at a lower resolution and quality compared to the image product, to carry out a visual assessment before purchasing the data.

## Find your scene

To download open data from the Resource Catalogue, first select the scene you want to download, by browsing and filtering the left hand panel to search.

## Go to the Assets panel

## Understanding file types

Most open data collections contain at least one common image file type, such as GeoTIFF or NetCDF files. Some collections come as Cloud Optimised GeoTIFF (cog) files when downloaded, which are another image file type containing the data for the scene itself.
