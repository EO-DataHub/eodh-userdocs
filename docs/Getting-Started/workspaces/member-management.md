# Member Management

## Role Permissions

Each workspace has 2 possible roles

* Admin
* Member

The Admin is the owner of the workspace. They can add/remove members, link commercial accounts (see Linked Accounts) and are responsible for any billing events.

The Member is a user that has been invited to collaborate within the workspace, with more limited permissions. They cannot take part in any administrative tasks of owning the workspace but can contribute to the workspaces data, access shared resources and use tools and integrations that are available in the platform.

## Add a user to my workspace

Click Add Member button in the workspaces UI for a workspace you have selected on the left. Then you add the user by statement username they have provided you with. If successful, they will appear in the UI, with key information about them such as Email, Name and Date Added.

When the other user logs in they will then see your workspace in their UI and be able to utilize it within the platform.
