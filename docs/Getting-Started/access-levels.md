# Access levels

!!! note "Access levels for users"

    There are three main Access Levels for the Hub. These are listed below along with the main 
    features of each. As a user interacts with the Hub more, then they will move through the three
    access levels to create a more powerful account.

## Open Access

* Browse the web presence
* Access the documentation tabs (About, Data, Getting Started)
* Access and use the resource catalogue UI (STAC Browser)

## User Account only

* Access the Workspace UI (but no permissions to create or manage a workspace)
* Be added to a EODH workspace managed by another EODH user which would provide the same access as users with a billing account

## User Account + Billing Account

* Create and manage their own workspace (e.g. add members) in the Workspace UI
* Access the Notebook service and be able to create and run data processing / analysis workflows
*Use Application Services
