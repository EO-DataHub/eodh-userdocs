# Billing accounts

!!! info
    You must have a [User Account](user-accounts.md) before you can create a billing account.

    Billing accounts currently do not involve any payments or charges. They simply act as a setup step for future billing features.

## Why do I need a billing account?

Billing accounts are a required step before creating a workspace and accessing compute capabilities like Notebooks or Application Services. While billing itself is not yet active, creating an account ensures you're ready once billing features are introduced.
