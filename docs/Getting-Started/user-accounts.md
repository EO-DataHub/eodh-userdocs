# User accounts

This guide walks you through the steps to register as a user to the platform using an external Identity Provider (IdP).

## Sign in
To register, click on the 'Sign in' button on the homepage.

This will bring you to a sign in form. To create an account on the Hub you must have either a GitHub or Gmail account. If you don't already have one of the above, first create a GitHub or Gmail account. Click on either IdP at the bottom of the sign in form.

This will prompt you to input your chosen IdPs user credentials. Logging in for the first time will also prompt you to update account information, as shown below.

## Authorise
When logging into the hub for the first time via GitHub, you will be asked to authorise EO-DataHub using GitHub keycloak, so the account can be used to login.

## Access permissions

Once signed in to the platform, you can access the Workspaces tab, but will not have permissions to create or manage a workspace. You can also be added to an EODH workspace managed by another EODH user, which would provide the same access as users with a billing account.
